Implementation
The goal of the implementation was to develop a ship port management system using Flask and SQLite. 
The Website provides essential features for managing ships, ports, and cargo. It includes user management for secure registration and login. 
Users can manage ships, captains, and ports, adding or updating details as needed. The system also tracks cargo, including its description, weight, and associated port.
A port reservation system allows users to book ports for ships, specifying arrival and departure dates. 
Additionally, the system generates reports to monitor ship cargo, reservations, and port usage, optimizing operations.

Conclusion
Achievements:
Successfully developed a ship port management system using Flask for the backend and SQLite for data storage.
Implemented key functionalities such as ship reservation, reservation updates, and reservation deletion.
Integrated user authentication to ensure only authorized users can manage reservations.
Provided a user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and Flask templates, offering easy navigation and management of ships and port reservations.

Future Enhancements:
Implementing more advanced features like notification alerts when port capacity is nearing full(constraint management).
Adding more detailed analytics and reporting, such as port usage statistics over time.
